       <p id="engineerfeeling"> I was born in a wealthier family. But even that my dad and mom have still farming and work a lot. And i understand how miserable farmer are. That why i want to do something to help them.<br>
        What is the mean of something ?  For now i don't really clearly about that. <br>I'm learning mechanical engineering. I'm gonna helping them by high-tech agriculture, no more allway depent on China, also sell processed products not only unprocessed products.<br>
        Imagine you stand before a large field with large machine are working, beside you are factory are processing farm products, behimd you is a lab are researching tech. That's so great, right.<br>
